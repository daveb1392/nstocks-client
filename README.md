# TDASH

A traders dashboard, this is the final project for the FlatIron course, where I combined the knowledge learned over the last few months into one solo project. 

Tdash was built thinking about a traders need to have all their information into one single source of truth.
Combining the most needed tools for trading I built a dashboard with fully customizable draggable containers that allow you to customize your dashboard as you please.
